    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for 
        special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. 
        It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. 
        For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li> 2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
             <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. 
                Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
             <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden.
                 Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
             <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp.
                 It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
             <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking.
                 If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
             <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
             <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. 
                Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices</li>
             <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li>
             <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
             <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li>
             <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish. </li>
